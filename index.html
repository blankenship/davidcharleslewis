	<h3>In Loving Memory</h3>
	<p><strong>David Charles Lewis was born November 22, 1949</strong> in San Antonio, Texas, the firstborn child of Betty Jean Gossett and Loys Vernell Lewis. He was a 6th generation Texan, having ancestors who settled the territory with Stephen F. Austin and fought in the Battle of Bexar before the Alamo. David had a long, celebrated professional life, starting work in the produce department at the Piggly Wiggly under the watchful eye of future brother-in-law, Roy Guerra, <em>“the best boss he ever had.”</em> David began service as the president of McCollum High School’s 1967 senior class, then as a San Antonio police officer. He continued in the National Guard during the Vietnam War, and eventually became the youngest IRS agent when he was hired. He received numerous awards at this post, sharpening his pencils to suss out transgressors. He finished his career working as an independent Certified Public Accountant, a self-proclaimed <em>“confirmed hippie”</em> helping fellow humans navigate the murky waters of tax law.</p>

	<p>David’s servant heart extended into his faith–he led church small groups in his home, woke early to mix sound for Sunday services, supported missionaries abroad, and even took the Gospel of Jesus Christ into the former Soviet Union. He came alive on those mission trips, relishing the experience of reaching former enemies with the power of Christ. He was a humanitarian everywhere he went, unafraid to clean homes or toilets or bail a friend out of jail.</p>

	<p>David was a devoted husband to Candy, the love of his life and high school sweetheart. They married in 1971 in San Antonio where they fell in love at 15 and 16 years-old. He was the proud father of two daughters and father figure to innumerable friends adopted into the family. His wit and humor popped in at just the right moment, and he prized anyone else who had the <em>“gift of good timing.”</em> David had a catalog of sayings to bring others joy and laughter: from marriage advice (Don’t marry anybody prettier than you) to spiritual exhortation (Remember RPG: rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all things; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18)) to personal mantras (It doesn’t get any better than this, and if it does, you can’t feel it). He was a consummate encourager, celebrating even the smallest triumph. His love of justice was strong, just like he was. His advice to <em>“give yourself good information”</em> was a call for clear thinking when life seemed uncertain.</p>

	<p>David was a man who made mistakes and repented afterwards. He wasn’t afraid to say he was sorry or that he had been wrong, even to his children. His humility was contagious. He went out of his way to serve others and lift them up.</p>

	<p>David was an accomplished traveler, ready to leave on a moment’s notice to go on any local or far flung adventure. He made notes on the maps of Europe, traversed the narrow cliffs of Hawaii and California, and memorized Texas’ country locales. He was a kind of early GPS, navigating the MAPSCO to take his daughters on “wrapping” expeditions to toilet paper multiple friends’ houses in the course of an evening. His favorite place, of course, was by the water, whether on a small fishing boat with his girls, walking Waikiki beach, or watching the sunset at Holly Lake with his wife. When travel was impossible, David roamed the earth via Netflix’s Our Planet or in his garden.</p>

	<p>David lost his life in an almost two year battle with throat cancer, a disease that left his distinguished speaking voice untouched until his penultimate day on earth. During treatments he reminded us to trust God, fix our eyes on Him, and not to worry, because he knew where he was going. During hospice care he prayed blessings over his children and grandchildren and took every opportunity to tell us he loved us. In his final breaths, David was surrounded by family and music, laughter and crying. He was a beautiful man inside and out, and he made a beautiful life with us.</p>

	<p>David is survived by his beloved wife, Candita Morales Lewis, and daughters, Jennifer Renee Ayers and Amanda Lewis Blankenship. He was proud to be father to two sons-in-law, Anthony Paul Ayers and Joshua Wade Blankenship, and grandfather to five exceptional grandchildren: Berenger David Ayers (15), Evie June Ayers (13), Shiloh Rose Ayers (3), Henrietta Akela Blankenship (5), and Moses Lincoln Blankenship (2). David is also survived by four siblings and their families: Gary Lewis, Steven Lewis, Dorothy Brown, and Mark Lewis. He will be greatly missed.</p>
